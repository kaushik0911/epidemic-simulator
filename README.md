# Welcome to Epidemic Simulator App

This application is a simple program that simulate disease spread within the community according to following properties,

1. Population size(number of humans).
2. Percentage (0-100) of the population to initially infect.
3. Probability (0-100) that a person gets infected when exposed to the disease.
4. Duration (in days) of the infection.
5. Mortality rate (0-100) of the infection.
6. Number of days to simulate.

Run the `main.py` file to see the simulation in a window.
```
python main.py
